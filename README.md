Course Project 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis
These are the results from the course project 1 assignment that uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository,
a popular repository for machine learning datasets. Within this repo you'll find the following:

4 pngs plots

4 R source code files

Each PNG file has a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

The plot files are named by their assignment number: plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

The R code files are named by their assignment number (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) 

Each R code file is matched to its corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. 

Each R code file includes code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 

Each R code file also includes the code that creates the PNG file.
